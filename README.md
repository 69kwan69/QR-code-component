## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my first time actually touch my hands on Git and Github, pretty cool.

### Continued development

By now, my CSS manipulation and management skills is quite...bad. Like I just see the sample and casually edit the stylesheet from up to bottom without organizing any assets.
